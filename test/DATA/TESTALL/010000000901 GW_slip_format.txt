(5/1/19) Every slip should start with the following contents (the numbers are line numbers, not a part of the actual file)


-----
1.
2.
3. <source:~PUT CURSOR HERE~>
4. parent links:~PUT CURSOR HERE~
-----

Remember that you can create the **link for the current slip** and copy it to the Clipboard by pressing Cmd-Opt-C. When you place the cursor as indicated by '~PUT CURSOR HERE~' (which is not part of the file) and do a Paste operation, you will get the lines correctly formatted. Example:

-----
<source:[[123456789012]]>
parent links:[[123456789012]] [[098765432109]]

You can write a Python program to go through all the slips and add child-to-parent links, where needed, on the 'parent links:' line.

for each slip in MTB (my thinking box)
    source = the slip's ID
    for each child-link in source
        go to child slip
        if the source is in the 'parent links' line, do nothing
        if it is not, add the source to that line
