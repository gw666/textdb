He says that curiosity enables him to 

* make a personal connection to other professionals
* broaden his knowledge of the world, added depth to who he is
* increase his ability to detect inauthentic ideas
* show people that he's into more than himself and whatever immediate goal he's pursuing

People may be more likely to do business with him because he's more interesting than others.
