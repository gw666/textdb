In _Killing Commendatore_, by Haruki Murakami (pg 428), Menshiki, the rich man of mystery, says:

---
I may be a clod of earth, but...I've been blessed with certain abilities. That's why go all out in whatever I do. I want to stretch myself as far as I can, to see what I'm capable of. I have no time to be bored. That's the best way I know of keeping fear and loneliness at arm's length.
---

That's why I'm so intent on getting as much meaningful writing done in the limited time I have. (M. regretted his limitations, and he was only 54. What I'd give to be 54 and have those extra years!)

He speaks of "keeping fear and loneliness at arm's length", but I find it more a matter of generating meaning and peace in my life.
