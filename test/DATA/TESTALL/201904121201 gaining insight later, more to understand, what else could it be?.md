There's always more to understand. Looking back, I remember a programmer typing so fast that he made a mistake and had to back up--he's wasting time, I thought.

Now I realize that he had internalized many programming structures (e.g., if-then statement), and he can now do it automatically--no thinking involved. He backed up because he realized he needed to use a slightly different structure (which he also typed automatically).
