**Every slip** in GW_thinking_box must have a 12-digit ID as the first 12 characters of the slip's filename.

However, by using very high numbers (ID numbers starting at "8000dddddddd", where d = a digit) as "reserved space", it's possible to put content that would otherwise be in a separate database or physical notebook. Here are the address spaces created so far:


190000000001 and above ['7' and 11 digits]: these are all "sources" that allow me to find the original material that I've written about in one or more slips--e.g., books, journal articles, online videos, etc. Includes terse list of topics, major ideas

(NOTE: Usually, the source for a webpage will be in the slip itself, especially if webpage pertains to only one slip. However, if the webpage is particularly important, it might be listed in this space.)


010000000001 and above ['8' and 11 digits]: documentation for GW_thinking_box (such as this slip)


000000000001 and above ['9999' and 8 digits]: "temporary trashcan"--you could probably delete these, but they're here just in case



Here are some useful keywords that may be present at the end of the slip's filename:

POSSIBLE Something you may be interested in owning; a possible resource
BOOK, EBOOK, WEB (webpage), VIDEO: nature of this resource
UNREAD   Here so you can find it later, when you are ready to read it
OWNED    means you own this resource (paper or Kindle book)
NOTES    means you have read this source; because of this, this slip
         should contain brief notes on what you find most important
         in the context of why you read this source
