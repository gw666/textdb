ABBREVIATIONS

* qn				question
* tbd				to be done
* unfin			unfinished


* **use '\\' to begin a pseudotag**--i.e., something that can be searched for but doesn't need a tag

- EXAMPLE: \\qu
- REASON for doing it this way: I don't want a #qu tag because a pseudotag may be temporary; no value added by making it a tag; don't want to pollute the tag-space

NOTE: '\' is a special character in regexes. When you want to search for the character '\', you will have to use '\\' within the regex ('\' escapes the character it follows)
