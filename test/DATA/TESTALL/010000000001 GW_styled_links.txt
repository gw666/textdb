# This is the structured link form that I will be using

**NOTE**: in all the instances below, ignore **...**; this is Markdown syntax for boldface, NOT what should be typed

Wherever possible, use the program's default link, [[slip-name]].

Wherever you desire, you can use the form ' **<<extra text 1 #mytag extra text 2>>**

# Here are the official GW_style_links (as of 6/17/19):
