# This is the structured tag form that I will be using

**NOTE**: in all the instances below, ignore **...**; this is Markdown syntax for boldface--you should type only what's inside

The default form is the tag format built into The Archive: **#mytag** .

I will use '\\' to create pseudotags (example: **\\wakka**, which mark things that I will temporarily want to mark for temporary use; doesn't polute the official tag-space

If you want more control over #tags, you can use the format
       '**<<extra text 1 #mytag extra text 2>>**'
(ignore the '**...**' which is text markup).

Both the prefix **"extra text 1 "** and the suffix (**" extra text 2"**) are optional. If you need neither, use the program's default, **#mytag** (note: no double angle brackets here).
