There are two 'locations' in a MMM. The first is where the original template is found (e.g., quakes on Mars). The second is where it is applied (e.g., a business with decreasing revenues).

'Worldspace' is the term used to point to either of the 'locations'. You can say that the former is the 'originating worldspace' and the latter is the 'target worldspace'.
