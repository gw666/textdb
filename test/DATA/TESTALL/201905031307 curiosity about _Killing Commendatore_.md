What could I say to get people interested in _Killing Commendatore_, by Haruki Murakami? It occurred to me to say:

A man had something happen to him that he couldn't explain.
Then he got an offer that he couldn't explain.
Then he met a man that he couldn't explain.
Then he heard a sound that he couldn't explain.
Then he found a place that he couldn't explain.
Then he met a girl that he couldn't explain.

(and that's just the first half of the book)

Using this in an article on curiosity, I would then write:

---
Doesn't that sound interesting? Wouldn't you want to read that book? Even if the book were bad (and it definitely is not), wouldn't you at least feel good about finding out what happened?

That's what it's like to have curiosity in your life. You're never bored, regardless of where you are. Life gets a lot more interesting and satisfying. And you will undoubtedly stumble across things that will make your life better.
