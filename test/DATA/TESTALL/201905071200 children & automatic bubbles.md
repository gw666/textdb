I just saw some toddlers with a battery-powered device that threw out a stream of pea-size bubbles. Granted, they enjoyed chasing them in a kind of delelious way. But what have they lost by not blowing the individual bubbles, learning how  to blow them so they get bigger and don't fail to launch? It's an example of getting the result without being involved in the act of creation.
