Curiosity, when it is followed and satisfied, reveals hidden knowledge.

What it reveals may contribute to an insight, a new idea. You may find it useful at some later point. It provides one more item in your big bag of knowledge.

At the very least, you will get the small bump of endorphins that results from satisfying your curiosity. (#question How does this happen? need details).

You also get the pleasure of knowing something that other people don't know.
