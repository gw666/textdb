Punning is about words, obviously. But how does one create a pun?

It has to do with having a rich store of linguistic elements, also of the techniques for creating puns in various different ways.

What occurs to me now is you have to have: a kind of fluidity of mind (which comes from practice); the desire to tinker; playfulness. more?
