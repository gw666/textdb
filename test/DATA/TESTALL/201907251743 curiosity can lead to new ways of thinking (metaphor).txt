Curiosity can lead to ideas, words, phrases, jargon, etc. that can be repurposed into some other realm.

(Good enough) example: "minimum viable product" is a business term, but you can apply the *idea* to other domains:

* "What is the MVP for this relationship?" (is this a metaphor?)
* "We can think of the Trojan Horse as an MVP strategy for defeating the Romans." (ditto)

This is a real-world benefit that comes from 1) being curious, 2) identifying the word/phrase/etc. as being potentially useful, and 3) remembering or writing it down
