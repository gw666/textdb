Meta-moments are one of four tools by the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. This tool is a pause-evaluate-act technique for overcoming sudden emotions and choosing an action based on what thinking about what their "better self" would do.

Key quote: "The Meta-Moment is a brief step back from the situation when we pause and think before acting. We ask ourselves, how would my “best self” react in this situation? What strategy can I use so that my actions reflect my best self? Over time and with practice, students and educators replace ineffective responses with productive and empowering responses to challenging situations."
