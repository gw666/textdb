In _Killing Commendatore_, by Haruki Murakami (pg 385), the main character's girlfriend, talking about their affair, said that the two of them may mentally be playing by different sets of rules about what they are to each other, what will happen, etc. But as long as they act with trust, respect, and etiquette (she felt the last was the most important), they could continue without ever talking about the rules of the "game" they're playing. If these three things aren't followed, they either agree on another set of rules, or they end the affair.

Are trust, respect, and etiquette a triple that has meaning in other situations?

Trust and respect are good in many situations. What might be some third thing that completes the trio?

I'm pretty sure you can have respect without trust. Enemies can have this.

People who love each other but can't live together can have this.
