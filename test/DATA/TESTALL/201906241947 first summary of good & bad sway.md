Improving your relationship is hard, so it makes sense to get the most bang for your buck—which means improving how you talk with your partner. You need to sway your partner in the direction of emotional connection. Good sway is saying things like "I really appreciate you doing that for me" or "Look at how beautiful that is", while bad sway is anything that damages your connection. It's commonly accepted that it takes about five positive interactions just to undo the damage from one negative interaction. So the most important thing you can do is avoid bad sway at all costs!
