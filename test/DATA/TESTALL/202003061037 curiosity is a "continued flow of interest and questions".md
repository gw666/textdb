Brian Glazer thinks that curiosity has a relentless nature to it (a "continued flow of interest and questions").

It includes:

* wanting to understand a situation better
* doing so by attempting to eliminate "blind spots"

When people are involved, one thing he does is to put himself in their place (mirror neurons) and ask questions like:

* What is most important to them?
* What are their immediate goals?
* How do they see the world?
* What kinds of thoughts do they have?
* What resources are immediately available?
* How do they respond to the immediate problem?

(He's using the astronauts in the script he was reading for _Apollo 13_ to come up with these questions)
