When using #positive_sway to recover from negative statements/damage to the conversation, if you feel empathy for your partner and are able to respond better with "I'm sorry you feel XXX, I'll leave you alone/Can I help/etc". This too is a positive sway action.

But be careful you're not enabling or reinforcing bad behavior.
