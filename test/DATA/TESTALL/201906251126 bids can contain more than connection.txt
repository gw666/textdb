Any bid can contain 'payloads' other than/in addition to the bid for connection. The following are all 'turning-toward responses', but look at what else they can contain:

* 'Hand me that magazine, would you?' ([A] request for another to act on person's behalf)
* 'What's the name of that doctor again?' ([B] request for information)
* 'Come look at this funny video' ([C] invitation to connection; also A)

Re. [B], I think "Remember when we..." should be part of sway, but not 'What's the name of that doctor again?'

I think I want type [C] to be part of sway--not sure
