Brian Glazer; a thousand people didn't think that making a movie about a mermaid in love would work. He felt that was 'knowing what nobody knows'.

Did he see that as a market opportunity? A sign he was more creative than them? Was it another way of saying that he belived in the idea?

Did he use this thought to persevere?
