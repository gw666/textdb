bad behavior, including anger, the Four Horsement, etc., can be seen as an blind, misguided, or ineffective bid for connection

it can be seen as an instinctual, even subconscious cry for help, or as an expression of a hidden need

for example, a person's sullen silence may be a desire for connection, a feeling of being left out, and a reluctance to make such known because of a fear of be rejected again

this doesn't excuse the behavior, but your ability to understand the issue underneath the behavior will help you make better decisions about how to deal with the other person
